> Flare is a modified version of [AKoD](https://github.com/tagoWorks/akod) which instead of using GitHub and Netlify servers, uses your own Linux server to host the data. Flare allows your users to validate their purchased activation keys from your site using a simple Discord bot command. Flare includes amazing additional features such as HWID/Node locking licenses, complete API and server access, and custom domains to make your project even more professional! To top it all off, the brand new [web dashboard](https://github.com/t-a-g-o/flare-dashboard) allows for easier setup, and shows some statistics about your keys & users.

# Getting Started with Flare ðŸ”¥

**Using Flare is a little more complicated than AKoD, as it utilizies Linux, so you will be in the terminal a lot. Flare also requires you to have a registered domain, in order to tunnel your server through Cloudflare.**

<img align="right" width="550.4" height="453.6" src="./readme/compare.png">

**You will need to have the following requirements installed on your server in order for Flare to work:**

   1. [Python 3.6](https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/install3/linux/)
   2. [PIP](https://www.tecmint.com/install-pip-in-linux/)
   3. [Node.js](https://snapcraft.io/node)
   4. [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
   5. [Apache](https://github.com/tagoWorks/flare/wiki/Installing-WebDAV#install-apache-web-server)
   6. [Docker](https://github.com/tagoWorks/flare/wiki/Setting-up-Cloudflare#how-to-install-docker-on-ubuntu)

### To get started, either [purchase a domain](https://github.com/tagoWorks/flare/wiki/Getting-a-Domain) or boot up your Linux server and start by [setting up WebDAV](https://github.com/tagoWorks/flare/wiki/Installing-WebDAV)!
